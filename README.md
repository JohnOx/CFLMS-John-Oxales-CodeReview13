Fifth Backend Project
# Big Events


Project Description:

Global event management company needs an application to track events. They would need to have a list of all their events with the following data:

Event’s name

Event’s date and time (start date and time should be tracked)

Event’s description

Event’s image (link to the image)

Event’s capacity (number of persons)

Event’s contact  e-mail

Event’s contact phone number

Event’s address (physical location, including street name and number, postal code and city name)

Event’s URL

Event’s Type (predefined list like “music”, “sport”, “movie”, “theater” etc.)  (note: related to the bonus points, not necessary for the basic grading)

NOTE: Please look into https://events.wien.info/en/ as an example website. Use it as inspiration to create your own design (and perhaps also as a source of the content).


For this CodeReview, the following criteria will be graded:

- Create a nice looking responsive theme you can use Bootstrap or just HTML/CSS

Implement interface for CRUD on Events (back-end functionality):

- Event index page: all events should be listed (like on the image above (event name, event date and time))

- Event view page: when a user clicks on the event, they should get an event view page with all the data that is stored for that event

- Event edit page: on this page it should be possible to edit the event data

- Event add page: on this page it should be possible to add a new event

- Event delete page: this option it should delete an event from the database

Bonus Points:

- Create filtering depending on the event type (hint: pass the information to the URL)


Note: Zip the whole project and upload it to the GitHub repository.
